</task>

<output_format>
## 1. Attack Workflow Analysis

### 1.1 High Level Attack Narrative
For the defined <threat_scenario>, provide:
1. A logical high-level set of attack steps/actions that a threat actor would most-likely perform in order to achieve their attack goal/objective.
2. Describe the real-world potential impact focusing on three (3) key areas:
  - Financial Impact
  - Operational Capability
  - Compliance and Reputation

### 1.2 Attack Chain Overview
For each identified attack stage, provide:
1. Stage Number & Name (e.g., Stage 1: Initial Access)
2. MITRE ATT&CK T-Code (e.g., T1566.001)
3. Technique Summary (2-3 sentence description of what occurred)
4. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): file hashes (MD5/SHA256), IP addresses/domains, file paths/registry keys, other artifacts
5. Transition (how this stage connects to the next)

### 1.3 Attack Flow Summary Table
| Stage | T-Code | Technique Name | Key IOC(s) |
|-------|--------|----------------|------------|
| 1     | TXXXX  | Name           | IOC        |

## 2. Attack Workflow Diagram
Generate a visual diagram of the attack workflow using one of these formats:

Option A — Interactive/Code-Based Diagram:
Create a React component, HTML/SVG, or JavaScript-based flowchart showing the attack progression.

Option B — Mermaid Diagram:
```mermaid
For example: graph LR
    A[Initial Access] --> B[Execution]
    B --> C[Persistence]
    C --> D[Privilege Escalation]
    D --> E[Lateral Movement]
    E --> F[Exfiltration/Impact]

Option C — Generated Image:
Use image generation tools to create a visual flowchart of the attack stages.

Option D — ASCII Diagram (Fallback):
For example:
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│ T1566.001   │───▶│ T1059.001   │───▶│ T1053.005   │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
The diagram MUST include:

1. Sequential flow showing attack progression (left-to-right or top-to-bottom)
2. Each node contains: T-Code, Technique Name, and at least one key IOC
3. Arrows or connectors showing stage transitions
4. Clear visual separation between stages
5. Color coding if supported (e.g., red for initial access, orange for execution)

## 3. Formatting Requirements

1. One-page equivalent layout (concise, scannable)
2. T-Codes linked to attack.mitre.org where possible
3. IOCs formatted for direct ingestion into SIEM/detection tools following STIX best practices
</output_format>

<guidelines>
1. Identify each attack stage and align it with MITRE ATT&CK T-Codes
2. Include T-Code, summary, and IOCs in each node
3. Ensure a clear, one-page layout for readability
4. Do not skip the visualization; select whichever option the platform supports
5. Prioritize actionable intelligence relevant to the specified industry
6. Include citations to source material
</guidelines>
