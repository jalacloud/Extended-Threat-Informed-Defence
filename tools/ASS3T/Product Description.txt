Advanced Security Selection & Evaluation Tool (ASS3T) //

ASS3T is an interactive and responsive set of dashboards created using Microsoft’s PowerBI platform. The tool uses the latest threat techniques and mitigations from MITRE ATT&CK v14.0.

Using ASS3T, you can quickly and easily identify specific attack technique information based on common adversarial threat objectives and determine effective mitigating controls that remediate the associated attack techniques.

This tool is best used in conjunction with threat modelling exercises to provide accurate threat and mitigation information that can be tailored to your organisation’s security posture.
