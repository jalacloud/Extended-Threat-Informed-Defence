ASS3T is an interactive and responsive set of dashboards created using Microsoft’s PowerBI platform. The tool uses the latest threat and mitigation data from MITRE ATT&CK v14.0.

Using ASS3T, you can quickly and easily find specific attack technique information based on well-known threat objectives and the associated mitigating controls that effectively remediate the techniques.

This tool is best used in conjunction with threat modelling exercises to provide accurate threat and mitigation information that can be tailored to your organisation’s technical estate.
