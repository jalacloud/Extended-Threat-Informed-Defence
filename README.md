## eXtended Threat-informed Defence (XTID)

A repository dedicated to the ongoing development, application and extension of threat-informed defence.

My work in this field aims to go beyond the established definition of threat-informed defence and explore and develop strategies, systems, and methodologies that use real-world threat intelligence to deliver business-driven security at scale.
